\item We propose the Robust High-fidelity Energy-Informed Autonomy Framework (RHEIA-F), an advanced energy-aware mission planning framework for unmanned aerial systems (UAS). This framework integrates comprehensive energy management into UAS missions, providing both off-board and on-board components. These capabilities are directly transferable to other Department of Defense (DoD) embedded systems, autonomous vehicles, and space systems.

% \item AutoKoopman is a python library for learning Koopman operators for data-driven dynamical systems analysis and control. The library has convenient functions to learn systems using a few lines of code. It has a variety of linearization methods under shared class interfaces. These methods are pluggable into hyperparameter optimizers, which can automate the process of model optimization.

% \item The BESSPIN CyberPhysical Demonstrator was developed under the DARPA SSITH Program. The demonstrator is intended to showcase the use of the SSITH secure hardware technology in a passenger vehicle. Visitors will experience driving a vehicle as it is being hacked, and the process of hacking an unprotected and a SSITH protected car.
